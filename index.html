    But luckily, you don’t have to win a <b>special hiking permit</b> or spend multiple days <b>backpacking in the Sierras</b> to enjoy the best of what the park has to offer<br>
     (you certainly can if you want, though!).<br>

            <h2>BEST TIME TO VISIT YOSEMITE</h2>
            <p>Like most national parks, Yosemite is open year-round. However, <b>much of the park is inaccessible in the winter and spring</b>, as Glacier Point Road and Tioga Pass close to high elevations.<br>
<br>
                That doesn’t necessarily mean you should automatically veto a trip during those months, however — it depends entirely on what you’re hoping to see and do during your visit.<br>
<br>                
                <b>In our personal opinion, the best months to hike in Yosemite are May and October</b>.<br>
<br>                
                To see <b>waterfalls</b> (most of which are accessible from Yosemite Valley), visit <b>between April and June</b>. Note that there will likely be quite a bit of snow on trails and at higher elevations in April and May.<br>
<br>                
                For <b>unimpeded access to the park</b>, when all roads and trails are open, visit <b>between July and September</b>. Understand that this is peak season, so crowds will be heaviest, and most waterfalls slow to a trickle as summer goes on.</p>

<H2>USING ALLTRAILS ON YOSEMITE HIKES</H2>
<p><b>Cell service in Yosemite is notoriously bad</b>. It’s also huge and has nearly 300 trails, many of them interconnected, so <b>it’s really easy to get turned around</b> — even on easy hikes in Yosemite.<br>

That’s exactly why I always <b>download trail maps ahead of time on AllTrails</b>. After hiking on the wrong trail for nearly 3 miles, I learned my lesson. Thankfully I’m a quick learner!<br>

The free version of AllTrails is awesome, but if you’re hiking in national parks (AKA cell phone dead zones), the <b>ability to download and access trail maps offline is well worth the $2.99 a month</b>.<br>

AllTrails+ even lets you try it for a week before committing, so there’s really no reason not to. At the very least, sign up for the free account and level up your hiking game.</p> 

<H3 align="center"><mark>ALLTRAILS+ — YOUR FIRST WEEK’S ON US. THEN ONLY $35.99 A YEAR (THAT’S $2.99 A MONTH)!</mark></H3>
<H2>BEST SHORT & EASY HIKES IN YOSEMITE</H2>
<p>With options in every section of the park and starting at just half a mile round-trip, short hikes in Yosemite pack a serious punch.</p>

        <H2>BRIDALVEIL FALL TRAIL</H2>
<H4>DISTANCE: 0.5 MILES ROUND-TRIP</H4>
<H4>ELEVATION GAIN: 80 FEET</H4>
<H4>TRAILHEAD ACCESS: BRIDALVEIL FALL PARKING AREA</H4>
<H4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</H4>
<p>Although it isn’t even close to the tallest waterfall in the park (that honor belongs to 2,425-foot Yosemite Falls), Bridalveil Fall is easily one of its most iconic sights. <br>

You’ll be able to see the <b>620-foot waterfall made famous by Ansel Adams</b> from numerous spots within the park. Amazingly, though, the best viewpoint requires a hike of <b>less than half a mile</b>.<br>

From the parking lot, you’ll hear the falls’ thunderous roar and may even feel its powerful spray. Follow the <b>paved trail right to Bridalveil Fall’s base</b>…and prepare to get wet!<br>

If the main parking area is full, you can also park along either side of Southside Drive, just a few hundred yards further into Yosemite Valley. This presents an alternative trail option, adding just .25 miles and crossing Bridalveil Creek.<br>

Note that even on relatively “dry” days, the he trail <b>end of tand the area around the viewing platform are extremely slippery</b>. Be extra careful and wear sturdy shoes!<br> 

Despite being paved, the <b>trail to the waterfall is not wheelchair-accessible</b> due to a rugged and somewhat steep grade. However, Bridalveil Fall is one of the easy Yosemite hikes that’s also <b>pet-friendly</b>.</p>

        <p>he Lower Yosemite Falls trail | Photo credit: Travel Mad Mum</p>
        <H2>LOWER YOSEMITE FALLS</H2>
        <H4>DISTANCE: 1.2-MILE LOOP</H4>
        <H4>ELEVATION GAIN: 50 FEET</H4>
        <H4>TRAILHEAD ACCESS: LOWER YOSEMITE FALL TRAILHEAD (SHUTTLE STOP #6 OR PARK NEAR YOSEMITE VALLEY LODGE)</H4>
        <H4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</H4>
        <P>Lower Yosemite Falls is easily one of the best short hikes in Yosemite National Park.<br>
        
        The <b>paved stroller-friendly trail</b> makes for a pleasant 30-minute walk to the bottom of Yosemite Falls, offering <b>spectacular views of Upper Falls, Lower Yosemite Falls, and the Middle Cascade</b>.<br>
        
        To access Lower Yosemite Falls, ride the FREE Valleywide Visitor Shuttle (7:00 am to 10:00 pm year-round) to shuttle stop #6.<br>
        
        Note: there is also a large parking lot at Yosemite Valley Lodge, but it gets extremely busy, so <b>riding the shuttle is highly recommended</b>.<br>
        
        Although the hiking trail is accessible all year, we recommend making a trip in the spring or early summer. <b>This is when the waterfall reaches peak volume</b>, providing a spectacular view from the footbridge — and a bit of splashing, for good measure.<br>
        
        The winter months are another great time to hike the Lower Falls Trail. Though the waterfall is unlikely to be raging, it’s usually frozen. The views around this time are breathtaking and unforgettable!<br>
        
        <b>From late July or August through October, the falls are usually dry</b>.<br>
        
        Hiking the Lower Falls is one the best easy hikes in Yosemite, as it’s a loop trail with a series of vantage points. In addition to the falls, you can also see Yosemite Creek and visitors may spot a few deer around the base of the falls drinking water.<br>
        
        Stop at the many exhibits along the way to learn more about the natural and cultural history of the area.<br>
        
        Even though the trail is just one mile, many people consider it to be one of the <b>most beautiful and rewarding hikes in Yosemite</b>.</P>

        <p>There are several ways to reach Mirror Lake, all of which are easy hikes in Yosemite</p>

<H2>MIRROR LAKE TRAIL</H2>
<H4>DISTANCE: 2 MILES ROUND TRIP, WITH THE OPTION OF A 5-MILE LOOP AROUND THE LAKE</H4>
<H4>ELEVATION GAIN: 100 FEET</H4>
<H4>TRAILHEAD ACCESS: SHUTTLE STOP #17 OR PARK AT CURRY VILLAGE</H4>
<H4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</H4>
<p>Mirror Lake Trail is one of the best easy hikes in Yosemite, and also one of the most popular.<br>

From the lake, you have a <b>great view of Half Dome above</b>. Once you reach it, you can stop and enjoy the views or continue on a longer five-mile loop around the lake itself.<br>

The hike to Mirror Lake is along <b>mostly flat terrain</b>, nothing too strenuous. The path winds through the forest between giant granite boulders, making for an interesting pathway. Much of the trail is shaded, but<b> bring bug spray</b>, as it can be quite buggy.<br>

When looking right at the lake, you’ll ideally see the peaks above reflecting in the calm water (hence the name Mirror Lake).<br>

We visited in August and found the lake mostly dried up, so <b>visiting in the spring or earlier in the season is ideal</b>. Mirror lake is actually a shallow pool fed by melting snow, so its level varies greatly by season.<br>

Being one of the best easy trails in Yosemite, Mirror Lake is very well traveled, but there are also signs warning of mountain lions, so if you’re <b>visiting Yosemite with kids</b>, make sure to keep them close to you.<br>

To access the trailhead, take the shuttle to stop #17, or park at Curry Village and walk.<br>

            <p> A section of boardwalk trail in Cook’s Meadow, one of the best easy Yosemite hikes</p>

<H2>SENTINEL MEADOW & COOK’S MEADOW LOOP</H2>
<H4>DISTANCE: 2 MILES</H4>
<H4>ELEVATION GAIN: LESS THAN 100 FEET</H4>
<H4>TRAILHEAD ACCESS: SHUTTLE STOP #5 (YOSEMITE VALLEY VISITOR CENTER) OR #6 (LOWER YOSEMITE FALL TRAILHEAD)</H4>
<H4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</H4>
<p>Making for a great <b>weekend getaway from San Francisco Bay area</b>, there are several amazing, easy Yosemite hikes doable for most people. One of the best is the Sentinel Meadow & Cook’s Meadow Loop.<br>
 
This trail is excellent for beginners or families looking to explore Yosemite National Park’s stunning scenery. The loop is just over two miles, and it provides hikers with beautiful <b>views of iconic Yosemite Valley, Yosemite Falls, and Half Dome</b>.<br>
 
The trailhead for Cook’s Meadow is near the Yosemite Valley Visitor Center. From there, the <b>trail follows the banks of the Merced River and leads to Sentinel Meadow</b>, home to some of the park’s most stunning views.<br>
 
Along the trail, <b>you’ll see El Capitan, Cathedral Rocks, and Sentinel Rock</b>. This is what makes Cook’s Meadow one of the best short hikes in Yosemite!<br>
 
After taking in the views at Sentinel Meadow, the trail continues on to Cook’s Meadow, a beautiful open grassy area with a <b>stunning view of Yosemite Falls </b>. Visit in the spring and early summer to see the falls at their fullest!<br>
 
This hike is considered very easy and suitable for all ages and fitness levels. It’s well-maintained, and there are plenty of opportunities to rest and take in the stunning scenery along the way.<br>

                <H2>GLACIER POINT</H2>
<H4>DISTANCE: 0.6 MILES</H4>
<H4>ELEVATION GAIN: 180 FEET</H4>
<H4>TRAILHEAD ACCESS: GLACIER POINT ROAD (OPEN ONLY IN THE SUMMER & EARLY FALL)</H4>
<h4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</h4>
<p>The hike to Glacier Point promises a marvelous view of Yosemite Valley in Yosemite National Park, California USA.

It’s among the best easy hikes in Yosemite and a fantastic option for beginners. Thanks to the gradual elevation gain, a <b>majority of the route is also wheelchair- and stroller-friendly</b>.<br> 

The trailhead begins at the end of 16-mile-long Glacier Point Road. A parking lot is also available here, with enough spaces for even extremely crowded days.<br>

This is also one of the best short hikes in Yosemite, with a length of only 0.6 miles, and there are plenty of extraordinary views. From the end of the trail, you can see Upper and Lower Yosemite Falls, Yosemite Valley, Clouds Rest, and Half Dome.<br> 

Yosemite Valley lies 3,000 feet below Glacier Point, which is what offers those breathtaking views. Unsurprisingly, this trail is also popular as a summer stargazing site.<br>

Apart from the beauty at the end, the entire trail is beautiful. Wildflowers and greenery grace the pathway through most of the summer.<br>

Remember, when Glacier Point Road closes from November to May, cross-country skiing is the only option to reach this trail.<br>

                    <H4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</H4>
                   <p> If you’re looking for an epic but short hike in Yosemite with <b>low effort and high reward</b>, then Sentinel Dome is THE trail for you. This moderate hike has you up on a rocky dome with stunning vistas over Yosemite within a single mile!<br>
                    
                    The hike starts by making a right from the trailhead. You’re going to be mostly exposed for the entire hike, so definitely pack sunscreen and a<b> good sun hat</b>.<br>
                    
                    While passing through a few trees, you’ll notice a large boulder up ahead. Once you make it to the base, choose your path and scramble up the rocky dome.<br>
                    
                   <b> From the top, you’ll get great views of Yosemite Valley, waterfalls, and Half Dome</b> right before you!<br>
                     
                    If you’re up for more of a challenge, you don’t have to turn around just yet. You can continue hiking and instead complete the <b>Sentinel Dome and Taft Loop trail</b><br>.
                     
                    This loop has you continue up to Taft Point, which brings you to a huge cliff overlooking Yosemite Valley. One of the best easy hikes in Yosemite, this extended version of Sentinel Dome ends up totaling a moderate 5-mile loop.<br>
                    <mark><b>Read more about hiking Taft Point and Sentinel Dome, one of the most spectacular easy trails in Yosemite, below!</b></mark><br>
                    
                    Best of all, you don’t have to decide which option you’ll take beforehand — you can decide after making it up the dome! To get back to the trailhead, simply follow the Taft Point trail down through a forest.<br>
                    
                    <b>Note that the parking lot for this hike gets full very quickly and is very small!</b> So getting here early is pretty important, not to mention it will make the hike easier if you’re not doing it at the hottest part of the day. This hike is mostly exposed.<br> 
                    
                    The Sentinel Dome hike is located off Glacier Point Road, which is a seasonal road closed during winter (typically from early to mid-November through May or early June). Make sure to plan accordingly!<br>

                    <H2>TAFT POINT AND SENTINEL DOME</H2>
                    <H4>DISTANCE: 5-MILE LOOP</H4>
                    <H4>ELEVATION GAIN: 1,100 FEET</H4>
                    <H4>TRAILHEAD ACCESS: GLACIER POINT ROAD</H4>
                    <H4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</H4>
                    <p>The hike to Taft Point and onto Sentinel Dome in <b>Yosemite National Park</b> is easy-to-moderate with stunning views of the park’s jagged peaks, free-flowing waterfalls, sheer granite walls, and down into the valley below.<br>
                    
                    Begin this trail, one of the most impressive easy hikes in Yosemite, by walking past huge boulders, through lush meadows, and into winding pine forests on the way to Taft Point.<br>
                    
                    The trees clear and hikers are met with massive cliffs, drop-offs, deep fissures in the granite, and <b>stunning views of El Capitan</b>.<br>
                    
                    These two hikes can be completed separately as out-and-back trails from the same parking lot (see the Sentinel Dome hike above!). However, the ridge connecting both easy trails in Yosemite is just as picturesque, well worth trekking the entire loop.<br>
                    Walking along the rim gives panoramic views of the park and culminates at Roosevelt Point, the halfway mark. This is the highest point of this trail, giving <b>glimpses of Yosemite Valley and Yosemite Falls thousands of feet below</b>.<br>

                    From Roosevelt Point, hikers begin walking along a narrow path that steadily climbs up and down, turning just after revealing Half Dome in the distance.<br>

                    The flat granite <b>top of Sentinel Dome rewards hikers with a 360° view</b> of the national park, and makes a great place for a rest and snack before completing the loop.<br>

                    <p>Looking for <b>one of the best easy hikes in Yosemite that’s almost guaranteed to have no crowds</b>? Add the Wawona Swinging Bridge to your park itinerary!<br>
                    
                    Far less well-known than the bridge in Yosemite Valley, this one in Wawona is the very definition of a <b>hidden gem</b>. Plus, it actually swings!<br>
                    
                    This is a <b>popular swimming hole in the summer</b>, when the river is calm and lower. It’s <b>accessible year-round</b>, but use extreme caution on the bridge when the river is raging.<br>
                    
                    <b>The trickiest thing about hiking to the swinging bridge is finding where to start</b>.<br>
                    
                    There are <b>two main options:</b> a dirt lot at the end of Forest Drive (2 miles past the Wawona Store) or a small lot about <b>0.4 miles past the trailhead parking for Chilnualna Falls.</b> In both cases, <b>drive to the very end of the road</b>.<br> 
                    
                    <b>Up for a longer hike?</b> Park at the Wawona Store (adjacent to the hotel) and hike along the paved Forest Drive for two miles toward the Seventh Day Adventist camp. At the bridge, take Chilnualna Falls Road back to form a 4.8-mile loop.<br>
                    
                    <b>Insider tip:</b> grab snacks and use the nice bathrooms at the Wawona Store or hotel.</p>

<H2>WAPAMA FALLS</H2>
<H4>DISTANCE: 5 MILES OUT-AND-BACK</H4>
<H4>ELEVATION GAIN: 200 FEET</H4>
<H4>TRAILHEAD ACCESS: HETCH HETCHY ROAD (BIG OAK FLAT ENTRANCE)</H4>
<H4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</H4>
<p>Are you looking for easy trails in Yosemite that are also less-crowded? Look no further than the <b>Wapama Falls trail in Hetch Hetchy Valley</b>.<br>

This 5-mile out-and-back hike is fun for all experience levels, and <b>offers beautiful scenery and an unforgettable waterfall!</b><br>

The hike starts by crossing over the impressive O’Shaughnessy Dam, then going through a tunnel that leads to the trailhead.<br>

The trail itself is stunning, as it <b>hugs the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir for almost the entire duration</b>. Though the construction of the reservoir continues to be controversial, this section of Yosemite is undeniably beautiful.<br> 

Like many other easy hikes in Yosemite, visiting Wapama Falls is highly recommended in the springtime. This is when the trail is lined with small waterfalls, especially after a winter of heavy rain and snow.<br>

As you hike along, you will experience varied and beautiful landscapes, with butterflies, wildflowers, and puddles perfect for jumping. At the turnaround, or “end” point, awaits stunning Wapama Falls.<br>

<b>In the spring, you can walk across a footbridge at the base of this roaring 1,000-foot waterfall</b>. Prepare to get wet! Crossing the bridge in spring is like taking a shower with your clothes on. <br>

<b>Hikers in the summer months will have quite a different experience</b>. The falls slow to a trickle, and you’re likely to find overheated hikers cooling off in the pools below.<br>

Know that the summer heat (which can stretch into early October in Yosemite) will make the hike more challenging. Pack plenty of water, sun protection, layers, and hiking snacks.<br>

For those looking for an unforgettable off-the-beaten-path Yosemite hike, Wapama Falls is the perfect trail!<br>

                    <H4>DISTANCE: 2-MILE LOOP</H4>

                    <H4>TRAILHEAD ACCESS: MARIPOSA GROVE ROAD, NEAR THE SOUTH ENTRANCE</H4>
                    <H4>ALLTRAILS NOTES</H4>
                    <p>Among all the best hikes in all of the West Coast national parks, the Grizzly Giant Loop Trail in Yosemite is one of the most fun.<br>
                    
                    This two-mile loop trail packs a lot of punch for very minimal effort, making it one of the best short hikes in Yosemite.<br>
                    
                    Located in the southern portion of the park, the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias is the largest sequoia grove in the park with over 500 mature giant sequoias. Imagine hugging giant trees that have been alive longer than your grandparents!<br> 
                    
                    With just 383 feet of elevation gain, the Grizzly Giant Loop Trail is perfect for hikers of all ages and abilities. Expect it to take around 1.5-2 hours, depending on your pace and how much you stop to take pictures and admire the huge, awe-inspiring trees.<br>
                    
                    The trail is mostly flat and, if you’re lucky, you will spot some of the many squirrels that call these massive sequoias home. A section of the trail is paved, making Grizzly Giant Loop one of the best easy Yosemite hikes that’s also wheelchair-accessible.<br> 
                    
                    Be sure to check out some of the most famous trees, including the California Tunnel Tree, Bachelor and Three Graces, and Grizzly Giant, which is 3,000 years old!<br>
                    
                    Mariposa Grove Road closes seasonally, and is generally open from early May through late October. When the road is open, a free shuttle runs frequently from the welcome plaza to Mariposa Grove itself.<br>
